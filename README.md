This site will serve as an interactive resume, highlighting all of my projects
to the best of my ability.


My name is Eli Kugler, I have been in the military now for almost 6 years as an Airborne Arabic Linguist. I am now transitioning into a role in software development. During my time in the military I have developed myself as a trainer, an analyst, and a leader. I am an avid lifelong learner with a unique ability to learn languages, written or typed, having learned Arabic to fluency in 16 months with no previous exposure.
